In order to supply these companies British Vita decided to install a compounding facility in Middleton. The facility grew very quickly and soon demand became larger then capacity.   In order to gain extra capacity an established compounding company was purchased in 1969 named British Recovered Rubber based in Clayton Manchester.

CU4268,The incident led the government and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to look at ways of combating this threat.Working with the government's scientific department the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of Melbourne the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) invested around $20m over the next two decades to develop a new paradigm in currency security.Guardian® polymer banknotes often referred to as ‘plastic money’ were first issued in Australia in 1988 - the year of the nation's bicentenary. The foremost commemorative $10 note contained both the first transparent window and first hologram of any type making it the most secure banknote of its time. After being successfully received by the public the RBA introduced a $5 note for general circulation in 1992 followed by successive notes in the years following. Throughout the 1990s Guardian® banknote substrate steadily grew in popularity throughout the world with the innovative polymer-based technology gaining the trust and confidence of more than 30 Central Banks to either adopt Guardian® for use in mainstream denominations or as a commemorative note as a test and forerunner to future use.In 1996 the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Innovia Films entered into a joint venture to create Securency International an arrangement that was concluded in February 2013 when Innovia acquired the RBA's 50% share in the business. The RBA proved an outstanding partner in helping Securency establish itself in the global banknote industry during a period in which some of the world's most successful companies including 3M and Mobil also attempted to enter the banknote substrate market but were unable to do so.With a heritage of innovation and technical expertise that makes Guardian® the world's most sophisticated banknote substrate Innovia Security is at the forefront of change and influence in an industry that has remained paper-based and relatively static for around 300 years

CU4507,Drayton Manor High School opened in November 1930 as a traditional grammar school inspired by the Public Schools of the 19th century and by the Education Act of 1902.  The school building was built on the site of Hanwell Park House land that was then owned by the local historian Sir Montague Sharpe.   After the Second World War as teachers returned from the services the new ideas of the Education Act of 1944 gave rise to a feeling of a better system of education for all and this was the start of a major expansion of the school which lasted until 1974.  Soon afterwards the school transformed into a comprehensive school.    The school celebrated its 80th anniversary on 8 November 2010 and continues to flourish as a well equipped co-educational comprehensive school with foundation status for students aged 11-19.  The school promotes the maximum development of individual students’ talents and potential within a tolerant and caring community.   At Drayton Manor we ask a high standard of our students by creating an atmosphere of encouragement with the emphasis on students developing the habits of hard work organisation and responsibility for their own work.
CU4510,Tayto Castle in the Ulster countryside is where the terrific Tayto crisps are made. The castle is over 500 years old and was originally the home of the O’Hanlon clan one of the mightiest and most powerful clans in all of Ireland.  In 1619 King James I of England confiscated the castle from the O'Hanlon's because they took part in a rebellion against Hugh O'Neill in County Tyrone. The castle was given to Sir Oliver St. John the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  The O'Hanlon's decided to try to recapture the castle during the war and 1641 and Sir Oliver St. John was shot through the head with a bullet while directing the castle's defence. In the raging battle that ensued the castle and the nearby church were burnt and destroyed. The ruins of the property then passed into the hands of other families and became the home of the Duke of Manchester in the 1800's.  In 1836 the castle was then rebuilt and truly became a home that befitted a Duke.  The entrance hall had a fine marble fireplace with an overmantle of richly carved Italian woodwork and the ceiling panels were painted with coats of arms of families connected with the history of the castle. The castle remained the home of the Duke of Manchester until 1939.  On 21st October 1943 the castle became the garrison home of the 28th Cavalry Squadron 6th Cavalry Group – 3rd United States Army.  The army used the castle and its grounds for training and preparation prior to being sent to England in April 1944 to prepare for the D-Day Normandy invasions.  The American soldiers were warmly welcomed by the townsfolk of Tandragee friendships were quickly formed and numerous marriages have resulted.

CU4520,Back in early 2000 I had returned from 6 months travelling to work with my family Ice Cream business.  Whilst working on one of the Ice Cream vans all the kids kept asking me repeatedly to get Pokemon cards in for them.  Their nagging persisted so in an attempt to get them off my back more than anything I decided to buy a box of cards from eBay from the USA.     Unbeknown to me the box contained cards not yet released in the UK.  The kids went crazy for these and word spread fast (think Willy Wonka's golden tickets).  I couldn't buy them fast enough and kids would come from all over the city to buy thousands of packs of cards on my rounds.  It was unbelievable.     Pandora's box had been opened and from there we evolved into selling a wide ranging portfolio of products on online marketplaces.  We decided we needed a brand so decided on the name LUPO. This is the Italian word for Wolf.  Near where my father was born in Calabria Southern Italy wild wolves roam in the mountain woods.  I thought it was a snappy name.     The LUPO brand now has an ever increasing portfolio of products and since we have opened our own webstore many more people have found our 'Simple solutions for Life'.     We hope that we can offer you the best products at great prices married to good service

CU5114,Scottish firm Critiqom is celebrating being awarded a contract to provide hybrid mail services to the public sector.  The company known as Document Outsourcing Ltd until January this year was awarded a framework contract as part of a broader series of postal goods services contracts awarded last month.  The framework contract was awarded jointly by two local authority procurement agencies — YPO and ESPO — and central government procurement agency Crown Commercial Service.  The portion of the overall framework agreement won by Critiqom covers the provision of off-site hybrid mail solutions.  It means the Critiqom hybrid mail offering has been pre-assessed for its ability to delivery quality and value and can therefore be used by potentially any public sector organisation in the UK.  The firm based in Bellshill outside Glasgow said it will remove the “inconsistency expense and inefficiency” of public sector organisations printing ad hoc documents for mailing via desktop printers.  Instead of being printed and mailed through “expensive” desktop computers and printers items can be electronically mailed to Critiqom’s print production facilities to be processed and dispatched
